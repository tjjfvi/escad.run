// TODO(ry) It'd be better to make Deferred a class that inherits from
// Promise, rather than an interface. This is possible in ES2016, however
// typescript produces broken code when targeting ES5 code.
// See https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/15202
// At the time of writing, the github issue is closed but the problem remains.

/** Creates a Promise with the `reject` and `resolve` functions

 *     import { deferred } from "./deferred.ts";

 *     const p = deferred<number>();
 *     // ...
 *     p.resolve(42);
